Sample files to configure Network Functions in VMs.

The Following are the file and class naming guidelines.

[1] The class name of the main Network Function configuration API class
    must be same as file name with first alphabet capitalized.
[2] Every class must define 
    [a] get_vnf_name() function to return the name
        of the vnf. This name and the 'slug' parameter in the request must be
        same.
    [b] handle_vnf_config(request_dict) function to hold the actual logic
        to process the network function configuration.
